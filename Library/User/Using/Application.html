<H1>Application modules</H1>

Until now we have described the Library core and the utilities. You might think: "This is all OK,
but how can I get the Library to do something, for example accessing a remote HTTP server?". In the
Library distribution file, you will find many modules that actually can do this and much
more. However, they are not part of the core but of the application. The application can register
the set of modules that provides the desired functionality which is basically what we have seen in
the description of the core. This section discusses the application modules and what functionality
they provide. The Library provides a special include file called <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which includes all the modules mentioned in
this section. This include file <EM>may</EM> be included in an application but is not required. <P>

OK, let's continue and get an overview of the functionality provided by the application modules.
