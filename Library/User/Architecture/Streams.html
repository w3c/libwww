<H1>Data Transportation using Streams</H1>

A <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTStream.html">stream</A> is an object
which accepts sequences of characters. It is a destination of data
which can be thought of much like an output stream in C++ or an ANSI
C-file stream for writing data to a disk or another peripheral
device. It can be anything that accepts data, for example another
stream, ANSI C-file stream, or even a black hole which absorbs data
without ever sending it out again. Streams are used to transport data
internally in the Library between the application, the network, and
the local file system. Streams can be cascaded into a stream chain by
directing the output of a stream which often is called the sink or
target into another stream.  This means that the processing of data
can be done as the total effect of several cascaded streams. <P>

From version 3.1 of the Library, streams are both used to transport
data from the application to the network and vice verse which enables
applications to send data objects to the remote server which is a
requirement for doing collaborative work using HTTP as the transport
carrier. The stream-based architecture allows the Library to be event
driven in the sense that data is put down a stream as it gets ready,
for example from the network, and any necessary actions then cascade
off this event. An event can also be data arriving from the
application which would be the case when an application is posting a
data object to a remote server. <P>

The Library has two fundamental stream classes which are described in
the following:

<UL>
<LI>A generic superclass
<LI>A structured stream subclass
</UL>

Apart from these classes, many stream modules have their own subclass
definitions of either the generic stream class or the structured
class. These definitions can be found in the individual stream
modules.

<H2>The Generic Stream Class</H2>

The generic stream class is a superclass of all other streams and it
provides a uniform interface to all stream objects regardless of what
stream sub-class they originate from. The generic stream class is
defined with the following set of methods.

<P><A NAME="Stream"><IMG ALT="Stream" SRC="../Paper/Stream.gif"></A><P>

<H2>The Structured Stream Class</H2>

A structured stream is a subclass of a stream, but instead of just
accepting data, it also accepts the SGML "begin element", "end
element", and "put entity". The conversion from a generic stream to a
structured stream is done by the SGML tokenizer which recognizes basic
SGML mark up like "&lt;", "&gt;", entities etc.

<P><A NAME="StrucStream"><IMG SRC="../Paper/StrucStream.gif" ALT="StrucStream"></A><P>

A structured stream therefore represents a structured document. The
elements and entities in the stream are referred to by numbers, rather
than strings. A DTD contains the mapping between element names and
numbers, so each instance of a structured stream is associated with a
corresponding DTD. The only DTD which is currently in the Library is
an extended version of the HTML DTD level 1, but current work is done
to update this to comply with the emerging HTML level 3 specification. <P>

As for generic streams, it is not required that the stream
actually has a output - it can for example be a stream writing to a
file where no output is required.

<H2>Cascaded Streams</H2>

Streams are often cascaded into a stream chain but before explaining
why a stream chain is a flexible construction for data transportation,
let's have a look at what kind of streams, the Library provides. The
stream modules be divided into groups depending on their behavior:</P>

<DL>
<DT>Protocol Streams
<DD>Internal streams that parses or generates protocol specific
information to communicate with remote servers.

<DT>Converters
<DD>Streams that can be used to convert data from one media type to
another or create a data object and present it to the user.

<DT>Presenters
<DD>These are streams that save the data to a local file and calls an
external program, for example a postscript viewer.

<DT>I/O Streams
<DD>Streams that can write data to a socket or an ANSI C FILE object.
This can be used when redirecting a request to a local file of when
saving a document in the cache

<DT>Basic Streams
<DD>A set of basic utility streams with no or little internal contents
but required in order to cascade streams.

</DL>

The first four stream classes often fall into a natural order in a
stream chain which is indicated in the the figure below. Here two
typical stream pipes are shown for data flowing from the network to
the application and vise verse:

<P><IMG SRC="InOutPipe.gif" ALT="Stream Chains"><P>

As a more specific example, the figure below shows how streams are
cascaded when data from a remote HTTP server is handled by the
Library. In this case, the stream chain is built as data arrives to
the Library from the network: The first stream can decide whether it
is a 0.9 or a 1.0 response from the first line in the response; The
HTTP header parser stream can decide the format of the body when the
header part is parsed and so forth. In other situations the stream
chain can be setup before data arrives if the format is known a priori
to the data acquisition.

<P><IMG SRC="InputStream.gif"> <P>

The ground symbol symbolizes that all data goes into a black hole
where nothing is radiated from. The two stream outputs going to the
application from each of the converters symbolizes that error
information is separated from other data objects. This allows the
application to direct any body part in an error message, for example
from a "401 Unauthorized" HTTP status, code to a separate "debug"
window where it can be displayed without affecting the current
document view.
