<H1>Include Files</H1>
<H2>Module include files</H2>Every module in the project should have a C #incldue file defining
its interface, and a   .c source file (of the same name apart from
the suffix) containing the implementation. <P>
The .c file should #include its own .h file.<P>
A .h file should be protected so that no errors occur if  it is #included
twice.<P>
An interface which relies on other interfaces should #include those
interface files.  An implemention file which uses other modules should
#include the .h file if it not already #included by its own .h file.
<H2>Common include files</H2>These are all in the WWW/Implementation directory.
