<H1>Language features</H1>Code to be common shared code must
(unfortunately!) be written in C,
rather than any objective C or C++,
to ensure maximum portability. This
section does not apply to code written
for specific platforms.<P>
C code must compile under either
a conforming ANSI C compiler OR an
original Kernighan Ritchie C compiler.
Therefore, the __STDC__ macro must
be used to select alternative code
where necessary.. (<A
NAME=1 HREF="Ex_Heading.html"> example</A> )<P>
Code should compile without warnings
under an ANSI C compiler such as
gcc with all warnings enabled.
<DL>
<DT>Parameters and Arguments
<DD> The <A
NAME=3 HREF="Macros.html#1">PARAMS(())
macro</A>  is used to give a format parameter
list in a declataion so that it will
be suppressed if the compiler is
not standard C - see <A
NAME=4 HREF="Ex_Heading.html">example</A> .  The
ARGS1 macro is for the declaration
of the implementation,  taking first
the type then the argument name.
For n arguments, macros <A
NAME=5 HREF="Macros.html#9">ARGn</A> exists
taking 2n arguments each.
<DT>#endif
<DD> Do put the ending condition
in a comment. Don't put  it as code
- it won't pass all compilers. 
<DT>#elif
<DD> Don't use it. Basic cpp doesn't
know it.
<DT>#preprocessor statements
<DD> DON'T indent
any preprocessor statements. They
must (for some compilers) begin in
column 1.
<DT>const
<DD> This keyword does not exist
in K C, so use the macro <A
NAME=6 HREF="Macros.html#10">CONST</A> which
expands to "const" under standard
C and nothing otherwise. -- See HTUtils.h
