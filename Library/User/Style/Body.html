<H1>Function body layout</H1>With the body of functions, this is the way we aim to do it...we're
not religious about it, but consistency helps.  If you think your
way is smarter, you may be right but this is the way we do it.  <P>
Whatever you do, NEVER make global changes to the indentation etc
in a file without agreement from me first. (It screws up diffs and
cde management as well as people).
<H2>Indentation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Put opening { at the end of the same line as the if, while, etc which
affects the block;
<LI>Align the closing brace with the START of that opening line;
<LI>Indent everything between { and }  by an extra 4 (FOUR) spaces.
<LI>Never indent preprocessor instructions (#ifdef, etc), nor increase
the indentation level on account of preprocessor instructions.
<LI>Block comments should start with /* in column 1, end end with */ in
column 1. In between, having ** in column 1 is conventional but not
necessary for very large comments.
<LI>Comment the closing braces of conditionals and other blocks with the
type of block, including the correct sense of the condition of the
block being closed if there was an "else",  of the function name.
For example,
</UL>
<XMP>			    if (cb[k]==0) {	/* if black */
				foo = bar;
			    } else {		/* if white */
				foo = foobar;
			    }			/* if white */
			} 		/* switch on character */
		    } 			/* loop on lines */
		}			/* scan_lines()	*/
