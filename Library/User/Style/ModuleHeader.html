initials intelligible. Use initials
in the history or in comments in
the file.
<DT>History
<DD> A list of major changes of
the file. You do not need to repeat
information carried by a code management
system or in an accompanying hypertext
file.
<DT>Section headings

file such as public data, private
module-wide data, etc should be made
visible. Two blank lines and a heading
are useful for this.
