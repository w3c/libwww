<H1>Protocol Modules</H1>

A protocol module is invoked by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A> in order
to access a document. Each protocol module is responsible for handling
the transmission of a data object either from the application to a
remote server, or vice verse. <P>

The protocol modules are registered dynamically (using static linking)
and the <A HREF="../Using/">User's Guide</A> describes how modules can
be registered. Each protocol module is responsible for establishing
the connection to the remote server (or the local file-system) and
extract information using a specific access method. When data arrives
from the network, it is passed on to the format manager.<P>

Most of the protocol modules are now implemented as state machines in
order to support <A HREF="../Architecture/Threads.html">libwww
Threads</A>.

When the client parses a request to the library a <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest Structure</A>
is filled out and parsed to a load function in the access manager, for
example <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html">
HTLoadAnchor</A>. HTRequest contains all information needed by the
Library in order to fulfill a request.

<DT><A NAME="z46" HREF="../../Implementation/HTFile.html">File access</A>

<DD>This module provides access to files on a local file system. Due
to general confusion of the "file://" access scheme in the <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/">URL Specifications</A> tries FTP access on
failure.

<DT><A NAME="z60" HREF="../../Implementation/HTFTP.html">FTP access</A>

<DD>This is a complete state based FTP client which is capable of
communicating with a lot of weird FTP servers. It uses
<CODE>PASV</CODE> as the default method for establishing the data
connection as <CODE>PORT</CODE> does not work if the application is
run from a firewall machine, as is often the case with <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/User/Proxies/Proxies.html">proxy server</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z45" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP access</A>

<DD>The <A NAME="25" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP
module</A> handles document search and retrieve using the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> protocol. See also information on
the <A HREF="../Architecture/HTTPFeatures.html"> current
implementation</A> of the HTTP client. The module is now a complete
state machine which is a required functionality in the <A
HREF="../Architecture/Threads.html">libwww thread model</A>. It uses
streams for both outgoing and incoming data, the outgoing stream is
implemented in <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTTPReq.c"> HTTPReq.c</A>
and the incoming stream in <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.c">HTTP.c</A>

<DT><A NAME="z40" HREF="../../Implementation/HTNews.html">News access</A>

<DD>The NNTP internet news protocol is handled by HTNews which builds a
hypertext object. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/construction.gif"> This module is under
reconstruction!

<DT><A NAME="z44" HREF="../../Implementation/HTGopher.html">Gopher access</A>

<DD>The internet gopher access to menus and flat files (and links to telnet
nodes, WhoIs servers, CSO Name Server etc.) is handled by <A NAME="26"
HREF="../../Implementation/HTGopher.html">HTGopher Module</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z72" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTelnet.html">Telnet access</A>

<DD>This module provides the possibility of running telnet sessions in
a subshell. It also provides functionality for rlogin and tn3270.

<DT><A NAME="z39" HREF="../../Implementation/HTWAIS.html">WAIS access</A>

<DD>WAIS access is not compiled into the Library by default as it
requires the freeWAIS library. This is easily changed in the platform
dependent <CODE>Makefile.include</CODE> in the

<PRE>
	WWW/All/&lt;platform&it;
</PRE>

directory. However, if this library is present then the application
can communicate directly with a WAIS server. Otherwise it must go
through a <A HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html"> gateway
program</A>.
