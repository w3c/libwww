<H1>Core Objects</H1>

The core objects are the structures that are a part of the core
entity. Each of the core modules as explained in section "<A
HREF="../Architecture/ControlFlow.html">Control and Data Flow</A>"are
relying on one or more of the core objects. This section describes the
relationship between the core objects<P>

<H2>Anchor Objects</H2>

All anchor management is handled by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor module</A>. You
should normally not have to look directly into the HTAnchor structure,
but use the methods provided by the anchor manager.

<H2>Request Objects</H2>

The <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTReq.html">HTRequest object</A>
contains all information neccessary in order to handle a request.

<H2>Stream Objects</H2>

Almost each stream module has its specific implementation of the
stream structure, but the generic one is defined in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTStream.html">HTStream Module</A>. The
structured stream definition is placed in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTStruct.html">HTStruct module</A>. None of
these modules have any code directly associated with - this is left to
the specific stream modules, for example the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTFWrite stream</A>.
