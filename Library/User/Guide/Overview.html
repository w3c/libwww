  W3C Library Interfaces
</H1>
<P>
The W3C Reference Library consists of a set of small APIs called
<I>interfaces</I>. This section is an overview of all interfaces in the Library.
An interface can cover multiple related C modules and it is defined by a
<B>WWW*.h</B> include file, for example
<A HREF="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A>. On
<A HREF="../Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows platforms</A>, each interface
corresponds to a DLL with a DLL definition file defining all exported methods
and data objects. You can also have a look at the
<A HREF="../Extrnals.html">complete list of all public functions</A>.
<P>
Every module in the Library has a HTML document associated with it containing
a detailed description of the functionality and interface to other modules.
This page is the top node for the implementation specific documentation and
contains links to all the modules in the Library. The documentation is
dynamically kept up to date as the actual include files (.h) are generated
from the HTML documents using the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode
Browser</A>.
<P>
If you are changing any of the interfaces then please note that when compiling
make sure that you have a relatively new version of the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> that parses the HTML documents
correctly (2.13 and newer versions). Find out what version of the Line Mode
Browser you are using by typing
<PRE>
	www -version
</PRE>
<P>
Also remember that when editing the module interfaces or adding functionality
then always use the HTML files and not the .h files!

  Basic Interfaces

<P>
The core interfaces must be included in all applications. <A NAME="dll"></A>

  <A HREF="../../src/WWWUtil.html">Basic Utilities</A>

<P>
The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and other
stuff that you can't live without when building applications. The modules
are used by the core part of the W3C Reference Library but can also be used
by the application. See also the main Library include file called
<A HREF="../../src/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> which contains all converters
and protocol modules known to the Library. You can include this one if the
application is to use all the functionality of the Library.

<P>
This is the basic include file for the core of the W3C Reference Library.
Together with the <A HREF="../../src/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil module</A> it
contains all core specific modules which are required to compile and build
the Library. The core part of the Library is designed as a set of registration
modules with no real functionality in itself. Instead all the functionality
comes when the application registers the modules that provides a desired
functionality, for example accessing HTTP servers or the local file system.
The Library has a special include file called
<A HREF="../../src/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which a lot of application helper
modules that makes it easier to use the core.

  Transport Protocol Interfaces
</H2>
<P>
All transport interfaces are registered dynamically in libwww. This means
that libwww is independent of the transport being used (for example TCP)
and you can therefore use libwww in any context you like. You have to specify
a set of parameters in order for libwww to be able to use it.

This is the include file for the basic HTML module that can be used together

modules which are required to compile and build the HTML DLL. Please note
that as the <A HREF="../../src/HText.html">HText</A> is <B>not</B> included
in this interface. The reason is that the HText interface only is declared
by the Library but must be defined by the application. Therefore it can not
be part of a DLL but must be included directly in the application.

  Application Interfaces
</H2>
<H3>
  <A HREF="../src/WWWApp.html">Application Utilities</A>
</H3>
<P>
A way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also known as a
configuration file. This is for example the case with the W3C httpd and the
W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic support for configuration
file management and the application can use this is desired. The module is
not referred to by the Library. Reading a rule file is implemented as a stream
converter so that a rule file can come from anywhere, even across the network!
<P>
Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they
can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help
doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry client requests through
a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and other
Network Optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol
translators" which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP,
to an equivalent request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher.
In case a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy server
which then handle the communications with the remote server, for example
using FTP about the document and return it to the application (proxy client)
using HTTP.
<P>
This module provides provides functionality for handling proxies, rule files,
and a large set of other application utilities that make it easier to build
an application using libwww.

<P>
The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding functionality. It
has hooks for adding protocol modules, like for example HTTP, FTP, and also
for adding streams that can convert from one media type to some other type,
or presenting the result to the user. In the distribution file of the Library
you will find a large set of protocol modules and streams already implemented.
However, in order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done
by using the methods in the <A HREF="WWWInit.html">WWWInit</A> module. You
can modify these modules as you like to fit your particular needs. The modules
in this interface are <B>not</B> part of any DLL and so must be included
directly if desired.
