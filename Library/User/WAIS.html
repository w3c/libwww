  The WAIS to WWW gateway
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="../">W3C Reference Library</A> supports <I>direct
<A HREF="http://www.cnidr.org">WAIS</A></I> access which means that
<B>all</B> applications built on top of the Library can serve as a WWW-WAIS
gateway. Making your application capable of accessing WAIS servers requires
that you link libwww with the freeWAIS library. Note that any type of application
can have direct WAIS access including servers and clients. This page explains
how you can set up your own WWW-WAIS gateway. There are basically two conditions
that must be fulfilled in order to do this:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A version of the <A HREF="../">Libwww</A> with <I>direct WAIS</I> access
    enabled
  <LI>
    The freeWAIS libraries from
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cnidr.org/pub/NIDR.tools/freewais/">CNIDR</A>. The version
    currently supported is <B>freeWAIS 0.5</B>
</UL>
<P>
If you do <I>not</I> enable direct WAIS access, your application may still
access WAIS servers by passing through another WWW-WAIS <I>gateway</I>. As
an example, W3C provides such a gateway as a special service. You can find
the gateway at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org:8001">http://www.w3.org:8001</A>.
Please note the special port 8001 which must be a part of the URL.
<P>
You can <B>enable </B>direct WAIS in libwww as an
<A HREF="../../INSTALL.html#features">optional feature in the GNU configure
script</A> Please read the <A HREF="../../INSTALL.html">installation instructions
</A>for more details
<H2>
  WSRC files
</H2>
<P>
The gateway keeps a cache of WAIS "source" files. These are files describing
WAIS servers, and are parsed, and are kept in the directory /usr/local/lib/WAIS
under the server name, port, and database name.
<P>
They are normally picked up automatically by searching a <EM>directory of
servers index</EM>. Once the gateway has picked up a description of a server,
it uses the description to describe the server to those who follow links
to it. (See the <A HREF="../src/HTWSRC.html">HTWSRC</A> module in libwww)
