  Libwww - the W3C Sample Code Library
</H1>
<P>
Libwww is a general-purpose Web API written in C. It is a highly modular
extensible API which can be used as the code base for writing Web clients
and robots. The purpose of Libwww is to provide a sample implementation of
HTTP and other Internet protocols and to serve as a testbed for protocol
experiments. It has a rudimentary HTML parser which can only do the very
basics. Please have a look at the <A HREF="../Amaya/">Amaya Web client</A>
for a HTML browser/editor application and <A HREF="../Jigsaw/">Jigsaw
server</A> for a full-blown server application.

  <B><A HREF="Distribution.html">Libwww Version 5.1</A> has been released to
  W3C members February 18</B>
</H3>
<P>
This release is a "second generation" HTTP/1.1 implementation using persistent
connections, pipelining, smart output buffering, and persistent caching.
It is the code base that was used in the
"<A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html">Network Performance
Effects of HTTP/1.1, CSS1, and PNG</A>" paper. It has been tested against
<A HREF="../Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</A> writte and

  User Documentation and Design Overview
</H2>
<P>
We have a huge amount of documentation about the design &nbsp;of libwww and
how to use it for building applications. Often, however, the easiest is to
study the example applications which show in practice how to do tricks with
libwww. We try to keep the documentation up to date but it may not always
be the case. The best thing is to have a look the list of exported functions.
This list is generated automatically and is always up to date.

  Mailing lists
</H2>
<P>
Libwww has the following set of mailing lists that you are more than welcome
to use! Before you send mail to the lists, please check out the archives
- they often contain good information about how to solve problems. Please
do not send mail directly to the authors - the mail load is already rather
high and you will most probably get a &nbsp;better response time by using
one of the following mailing lists.
