The DNS Class defines generic access to &nbsp;the DNS system. It maintains
a cache of all visited hosts so that subsequent connects to the same host
doesn't imply a new request to the DNS every time. Multihomed hosts are treated
specially in that the time spend on every connect is measured and kept in
the cache. On the next request to the same host, the IP-address with the
lowest average connect time is chosen. If one IP-address fails completely,
e.g. <EM>connection refused</EM> then it disabled and HTDoConnect tries one
of the other IP-addresses to the same host.
<P>
Every entry in the cache has its own time to live (TTL) and hence the cache
manages its own automatic garbage collection. Currently the TTL is <B>not</B>
bound to the DNS records which should be changed. You can set the DNS object
TTL
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTDNS.c">HTDNS.c</A>, and it is a
part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C Reference
Library</A>.

  DNS Cache Expiration Time
</H2>
<P>
When to remove an entry in the cache. The default value is 12h.

  Creation and Deletion Methods
</H2>
<H3>
  Add a DNS Object
</H3>
<P>
Add an element to the cache of visited hosts. The <CODE>homes</CODE> variable
indicates the number of IP addresses found when looking up the name. A host
name must <B>NOT</B> contain a port number.
<PRE>
extern HTdns * HTDNS_add (HTList * list, struct hostent * element,
			  char * host, int * homes);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Delete a DNS object
</H3>
<P>
This function flushes the DNS object from the cache and frees up memory
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTDNS_delete (const char * host);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Delete ALL DNS objects
</H3>
<P>
This function is called from <A HREF="HTLib.html">
HTLibTerminate</A>. It can be called at any point in time if the DNS cache
is going to be flushed.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTDNS_deleteAll (void);

  Recalculating the Time Weights on Multihomed Host
</H3>
<P>
On every connect to a multihomed host, the average connect time is updated
exponentially for all the entries.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTDNS_updateWeigths (HTdns *dns, int cur, time_t deltatime);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Resolver Functions
</H2>
<P>
These are the functions that resolve a host name
<H3>
  Get Host By Socket
</H3>
<P>
This function should have been called HTGetHostByAddr but for historical
reasons this is not the case.
<PRE>
extern char * HTGetHostBySock (int soc);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Get Host By Name
</H3>
<P>
This function gets the address of the host and puts it in to the socket
structure. It maintains its own cache of connections so that the communication
to the Domain Name Server is minimized. Returns the number of homes or -1
if error.
<PRE>
extern int HTGetHostByName (struct _HTNet *net, char *host);
