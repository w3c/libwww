<P>
This module is the private part of the request object. It has the functions
declarations that are private to the Library and that shouldn't be used by
applications. The module has been separated from the old HTAccess module.
See also the public part of the declarition in the <A HREF="HTReq.html">HTReq
Module</A>.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTReqMan.c">HTReqMan.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C Reference
Library</A>.

<P>
When a request is handled, all kinds of things about it need to be passed
along together with a request. It is intended to live as long as the request
is still active, but can be deleted as soon as it has terminated. Only the
anchor object stays around after the request itself is terminated.
<PRE>
struct _HTRequest {

    BOOL		internal;      /* Does the app knows about this one? */

    time_t		date;      /* Time stamp when the request was issued */

    HTMethod		method;

    BOOL                flush;                /* Should we flush immediately */

    HTPriority		priority;		/* Priority for this request */
</PRE>
<H3>
  User Profile
</H3>
<P>
Each request can be assigned a <A HREF="HTUser.html">user profile</A> containing
information about this host and the user issuing the request.
<PRE>
    HTUserProfile *	userprofile;
</PRE>

<H3>
Net Object
</H3>
Each request is assigned a Net object which contains pointers to other objects handling the request.
<PRE>
    HTNet *		net;		    /* Information about socket etc. */
</PRE>

<H3>
Response Object
</H3>

When we start getting MIME headers in as a response we keep it in this object until we know what to do with it.

<PRE>
    HTResponse *        response;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Error Manager
</H3>
<PRE>
    HTList *		error_stack;		           /* List of errors */
</PRE>

<H3>
Have many times do We Want to Try?
</H3>

<PRE>
    int			retrys;       	      /* Number of automatic reloads */
    int                 max_forwards;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Preemtive or Non-Preemptive load?
</H3>

Each protocol module is registered with a default behavior but if you have registered a protocol module for non-preemtive load you can override this by using the following flag.

<PRE>
    BOOL		preemptive;
</PRE>

<H3>
Content Negotiation
</H3>

Normally, when we access the local file system we do content negotiation in order to find the most suited representation. However, you can turn this off by using the following flag.

<PRE>
    BOOL		ContentNegotiation;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Headers and header information
</H3>

These are the masks that decides what headers to send.

<PRE>
    HTGnHd		GenMask;
    HTRsHd		ResponseMask;
    HTRqHd		RequestMask;
    HTEnHd		EntityMask;

    HTList *		generators;
    BOOL		gens_local;
</PRE>

<H3>
Local MIME Header Parsers 
</H3>

Each request can be assigned its own MIME header parsers.

<PRE>
    HTMIMEParseSet *	parseSet;
    BOOL		pars_local;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Accept headers
</H3>

These are the accept headers that we want to send out.

<PRE>
    HTList *		conversions;
    BOOL		conv_local;

    HTList *		encodings;
    BOOL		enc_local;

    HTList *		ctes;
    BOOL		cte_local;

    HTList *		languages;
    BOOL		lang_local;

    HTList *		charsets;
    BOOL		char_local;

    HTList *		befores;
    BOOL		befores_local;

    HTList *		afters;
    BOOL		afters_local;
</PRE>

<H3>
Are we using a Proxy?
</H3>

If so then we keep the name in this variable

<PRE>
    char * 		proxy;
    BOOL                full_uri;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Cache Control Directives
</H3>
<P>
This association list is a list of the cache control directives that are
to be sent as part of the <CODE>Cache-Control</CODE> header.
<PRE>
    HTReload		reload;
    HTAssocList *       cache_control;
</PRE>

<H3>
Byte Ranges
</H3>

This association list is a list of the cache control directives that are
to be sent as part of the <CODE>Range</CODE> header.

<PRE>
    HTAssocList *       byte_ranges;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Connection Control Directives
</H3>
<P>
This association list is a list of the connection control directives that
are to be sent as part of the <CODE>Connection</CODE> header.

<PRE>
    HTAssocList *       connection;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Access Authentication Information
</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>credentials</CODE> list contains the information that we are to send as part of the <CODE>Authorization</CODE> header. The realm is if we already know that we need to generate credentials for a specific realm.
<PRE>
    char *		realm;				    /* Current realm */
    HTAssocList *	credentials;	   /* Credentials received by server */
</PRE>
<H3>
  Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP) Information
</H3>

These association lists contain the information that we are to send as PEP headers in the request.

<PRE>
    HTAssocList *	protocol;
    HTAssocList *	protocol_info;
    HTAssocList *	protocol_request;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Anchors
</H3>
<PRE>
    HTParentAnchor *	anchor;	       /* The Client anchor for this request */

    HTChildAnchor *	childAnchor;	    /* For element within the object */
    HTParentAnchor *	parentAnchor;			/* For referer field */
</PRE>
<H3>

These functions are mainly used internally in the Library but there is no
reason for them not to be public.
