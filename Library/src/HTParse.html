This module contains code to parse URIs and various related things such as:

<A NAME="parse"><H2>Parsing URIs</H2></A>

These functions can be used to get information in a URI.

<H3>Parse a URI relative to another URI</H3>

This returns those parts of a name which are given (and requested)
substituting bits from the related name where necessary. The
<CODE>aName</CODE> argument is the (possibly relative) URI to be
parsed, the <CODE>relatedName</CODE> is the URI which the
<CODE>aName</CODE> is to be parsed relative to. Passing an empty
string means that the <CODE>aName</CODE> is an absolute URI. The
following are flag bits which may be OR'ed together to form a number
to give the 'wanted' argument to HTParse.

<PRE>
#define PARSE_ACCESS		16
#define PARSE_HOST		 8
#define PARSE_PATH		 4
#define PARSE_ANCHOR		 2
#define PARSE_PUNCTUATION	 1
#define PARSE_ALL		31
</PRE>

where the format of a URI is as follows:

<PRE>
/*
	ACCESS :// HOST / PATH # ANCHOR
*/
</PRE>

<CODE>PUNCTUATION</CODE> means any delimiter like '/', ':', '#'
between the tokens above.

The string returned by the function must be freed by the caller.

<PRE>
extern char * HTParse  (CONST char * aName, CONST char * relatedName,
			int wanted);
</PRE>

<H3>Create a Relative (Partial) URI</H3>

This function creates and returns a string which gives an expression
of one address as related to another.  Where there is no relation, an
absolute address is retured.

<H3>On entry,</H3>Both names must be absolute, fully
qualified names of nodes (no anchor
bits)
<H3>On exit,</H3>The return result points to a newly
allocated name which, if parsed by
HTParse relative to relatedName,
will yield aName. The caller is responsible
for freeing the resulting name later.

<PRE>
extern char * HTRelative (CONST char * aName, CONST char *relatedName);
</PRE>

<A NAME="canon"><H2>Canonicalization</H2></A>

Canonicalization of URIs is a difficult job, but it saves a lot of
down loads and double entries in the cache if we do a good job. A URI
is allowed to contain the seqeunce xxx/../ which may be replaced by ""
, and the seqeunce "/./" which may be replaced by "/".  Simplification
helps us recognize duplicate URIs. Thus, the following transformations
are done:

<UL>
<LI> /etc/junk/../fred 	becomes	/etc/fred
<LI> /etc/junk/./fred	becomes	/etc/junk/fred
</UL>

but we should NOT change
<UL>
<LI> http://fred.xxx.edu/../.. or
<LI> ../../albert.html
</UL>

In the same manner, the following prefixed are preserved:

<UL>
<LI> ./<etc>
<LI> //<etc>
</UL>

In order to avoid empty URIs the following URIs become:

<UL>
<LI> /fred/..			becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/././..		becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/.././junk/.././	becomes /fred/..
</UL>

If more than one set of `://' is found (several proxies in cascade) then
only the part after the last `://' is simplified.

<PRE>
extern char *HTSimplify (char **filename);
</PRE>

<A NAME="secure"><H2>Prevent Security Holes</H2></A>

In many telnet like protocols, it can be very dangerous to allow a
full ASCII character set to be in a URI. Therefore we have to strip
them out.

<CODE>HTCleanTelnetString()</CODE> makes sure that the given string
doesn't contain characters that could cause security holes, such as
newlines in ftp, gopher, news or telnet URLs; more specifically:
allows everything between hexadesimal ASCII 20-7E, and also A0-FE,
inclusive.
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>str</CODE>
<DD> the string that is *modified* if necessary.  The string will be
     truncated at the first illegal character that is encountered.
<DT>returns
<DD> YES, if the string was modified.
     NO, otherwise.
</DL>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTCleanTelnetString (char * str);
