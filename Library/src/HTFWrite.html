It is useful to have both FWriter and Writer for environments in which
<CODE>fdopen()</CODE> doesn't exist for example. The module contains the
following parts:

    <A HREF="#utils">Basic Utility Streams</A>

    <A HREF="#write">An ANSI C File Writer Stream</A>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTFWrite.c">HTFWrite.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">W3C Reference

  <A NAME="write">ANSI C File Writer Stream</A>
</H2>
<P>
This function puts up a new stream given an <I>open</I> file descripter.
If the file is <I>not</I> to be closed afterwards, then set
<CODE>leave_open=NO</CODE>.

extern HTStream * HTFWriter_new	(HTRequest * request,
				 FILE * fp,
				 BOOL leave_open);

  Various Converters using the File Writer Stream
</H2>
<P>
This is a set of functions that can be registered as converters. They all
use the basic ANSI C file writer stream for writing out to the local file
system.
<PRE>
extern HTConverter HTSaveAndExecute, HTSaveLocally, HTSaveAndCallback;
</PRE>
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>HTSaveLocally</CODE>
  <DD>
    Saves a file to local disk. This can for example be used to dump date objects
    of unknown media types to local disk. The stream prompts for a file name
    for the temporary file.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HTSaveAndExecute</CODE>
  <DD>
    Creates temporary file, writes to it and then executes system command (maybe
    an external viewer) when <CODE>EOF</CODE> has been reached. The stream finds
    a suitable name of the temporary file which preserves the suffix. This way,
    the system command can find out the file type from the name of the temporary
    file name.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HTSaveAndCallback</CODE>
  <DD>
    This stream works exactly like the <CODE>HTSaveAndExecute</CODE> stream but
    in addition when <CODE>EOF</CODE> has been reached, it checks whether a callback
    function has been associated with the request object in which case, this
    callback is being called. This can be use by the application to do some
    processing <EM>after</EM> the system command has terminated. The callback
    function is called with the file name of the temporary file as parameter.
