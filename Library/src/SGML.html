The SGML parser is a state machine. It is called for every character of the
input stream. The DTD data structure contains pointers to functions which
are called to implement the actual effect of the text read. When these functions
are called, the attribute structures pointed to by the DTD are valid, and
the function is parsed a pointer to the curent tag structure, and an "element
stack" which represents the state of nesting within SGML elements. See also
the <A HREF="HTStream.html">the generic Stream definition</A>
<P>
The following aspects are from Dan Connolly's suggestions: Binary search,
Strcutured object scheme basically, SGML content enum type.

This module is implemented by <A HREF="SGML.c">SGML.c</A>, and it is a part
of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">W3C Reference Library</A>.
