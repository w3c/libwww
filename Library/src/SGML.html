<TITLE>SGML parse and stream definition for libwww</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>SGML and Structured streams</H1>The SGML parser is a state machine.
It is called for every character of the input stream. The DTD data
structure contains pointers to functions which are called to
implement the actual effect of the text read. When these functions are
called, the attribute structures pointed to by the DTD are valid,
and the function is parsed a pointer to the curent tag structure, and
an "element stack" which represents the state of nesting within SGML
elements.<P>

The following aspects are from Dan
Connolly's suggestions:  Binary search,
Strcutured object scheme basically,
SGML content enum type.<P>

The module is a part of the <A HREF="Overview">CERN Common WWW Library</A>

<H2>Structured Object definition</H2>A structured object is something
which can reasonably be represented
in SGML.  I'll rephrase that.  A
structured object is am ordered tree-structured
arrangement of data which is representable
as text.The SGML parer outputs to
a Structured object. A Structured
object can output its contents to
another Structured Object. It's a
kind of typed stream. The architecure
is largely Dan Conolly's. Elements
and entities are passed to the sob
by number, implying a knowledge of
the DTD. Knowledge of the SGML syntax
is not here, though.<P>
Superclass: HTStream<P>
The creation methods will vary on
the type of Structured Object.Maybe
the callerData is enough info to
pass along.
