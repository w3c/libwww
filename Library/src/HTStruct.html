A structured object is something which can reasonably be represented
in for eaxmple SGML.  I'll rephrase that.  A structured object is am
ordered tree-structured arrangement of data which is representable as
text. An example is the SGML parser which outputs to a
<CODE>Structured Object</CODE>. A Structured object can output its
contents to another <CODE>Structured Object</CODE>. It's a kind of
typed stream. The architecure is largely Dan Conolly's. Elements and
entities are passed to the sob by number, implying a knowledge of the
DTD.<P>

The <CODE>Streuctured Stream</CODE> is a subclass of a <A
HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Object</A>. As always, we don't
have classes in basic C so we have to do this by hand! <P>

<B>NOTE:</B> The <CODE>put_block</CODE> method was <CODE>write</CODE>,
but this upset systems which had macros for <CODE>write()</CODE>. See
the <A HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Definition</A> for valid
return codes.<P>

typedef struct _HTStructured HTStructured;

typedef struct _HTStructuredClass {

    char * name;

    int (*flush)	(HTStructured * me);

    int (*_free)	(HTStructured *	me);

    int (*abort)	(HTStructured *	me, HTList * errorlist);

    int (*put_character)(HTStructured *	me, char ch);

    int (*put_string)	(HTStructured *	me, CONST char * str);

    int (*put_block)	(HTStructured * me, CONST char * str, int len);

See the <A HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Definition</A> for an
explanation of these methods. Note that they all have a
<CODE>HTStructured</CODE> object a the parameter, not a generic
stream. This is to avoid <EM>incompatible pointer</EM> warnings
