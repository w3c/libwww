This version of the stream object just writes to a socket. The socket
is assumed open and closed afterward.There are two versions (identical
on ASCII machines) one of which converts to ASCII on output.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWriter.c">HTWriter.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.

<H3>Bugs:</H3>

<LI>strings written must be less than
buffer size.
