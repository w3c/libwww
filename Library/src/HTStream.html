<H1>Stream Object definition</H1>A Stream object is something which
accepts a stream of text.<P>
The creation methods will vary on
the type of Stream Object.   All
creation methods return a pointer
to the stream type below.<P>
As you can see, but the methods used
to write to the stream and close
it are pointed to be the object itself.
<PRE>#ifndef HTSTREAM_H
#define HTSTREAM_H

#include "HTUtils.h"

typedef struct _HTStream HTStream;

</PRE>These are the common methods of all
streams.  They should be self-explanatory,
except for end_document which must
be called before free.  It should
be merged with free in fact:  it
should be dummy for new streams.<P>
The put_block method was write, but
this upset systems whiuch had macros
for write().
<PRE>typedef struct _HTStreamClass {

	char*  name;				/* Just for diagnostics */
		
	void (*_free) PARAMS((
		HTStream*	me));

	void (*abort) PARAMS((
		HTStream*	me,
		HTError		e));
		
	void (*put_character) PARAMS((
		HTStream*	me,

	void (*put_string) PARAMS((
