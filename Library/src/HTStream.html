A Stream object is something which accepts a stream of text. See also
the <A HREF="HTStruct.html">Structured stream
definition.</A>. Generally streams are cascaded into stream pipes
where the output of a stream is directed into the input of the down
stream object. However, it is not required that a stream has a target,
it might as well be a black hole that just swallows data. <P>

The creation methods will vary on the type of Stream Object.  All
creation methods return a pointer to the stream object below.<P>

This module is a part of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">
W3C Reference Library</A>.

<B>NOTE: </B>All methods in the stream definition do now return an
integer. The general return codes from the methods are:

<UL>
<LI><B>HT_WOULD_BLOCK</B>
<LI><B>HT_ERROR</B>
<LI><B>HT_OK</B>
<LI><B>&gt;0</B> - any return greater than 0 will result in that the
return code will be parsed on from the <A
HREF="HTSocket.html#Read">HTSocketRead</A>. This can be used by
inidividual stream to introduce their own return codes.
</UL>

As streams now have a return value, it is <B>very</B> important that
these return values are passed upstream to all the other streams in
the stream pipe. <P>

It is not relevant to return how much data has been written in the
stream, as there often will be a relationship other than 1:1 between
indata and outdata. However, it is important that a stream keeps state
(eitheron the indata or the outdata) so that it can accept a
HT_WOULD_BLOCK and continue at a later time when the blocking
situation has stopped.

#ifndef HTSTREAM_H
#define HTSTREAM_H

#include "HTList.h"

typedef struct _HTStream HTStream;

typedef struct _HTStreamClass {

    char * name;
</PRE>

This field is for diagnostics only
		
<PRE>
    int (*flush)	(HTStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>flush</CODE> method is introduced in order to allow the
stream to put any buffered data down the stream pipe but without
taking the stream pipe down. It is for the stream to decide whether it
has buffered data or not. In some situations, the stream might not
want to send buffered data down the target as the date might be
relevant for this stream only.

<PRE>
    int (*_free)	(HTStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>free</CODE> method is like the <CODE>flush</CODE> method but
it also frees the current stream object and all stream objects down
stream. When the <CODE>free</CODE> method has been called, the
<EM>whole</EM> stream pipe (not only this obejct) should not accept
any more data.

<PRE>
    int (*abort)	(HTStream * me, HTList * errorlist);
</PRE>

The <CODE>abort</CODE> method should only be used if a stream is
interrupted, for example by the user, or an error occurs.

<PRE>
    int (*put_character)(HTStream * me, char ch);
				
    int (*put_string)	(HTStream * me, CONST char * str);

    int (*put_block)	(HTStream * me, CONST char * str, int len);
</PRE>

These methods are for actually putting data down the stream. It is
important that the most efficient method is chosen (often
put_block). There is no guarantee that a stream won't change method,
for example from <CODE>put_character</CODE> to <CODE>put_block</CODE>
