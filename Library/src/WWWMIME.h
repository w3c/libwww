(
  MIME Entity Header Parsing
)

The libwww MIME parsers are completely generic in that they don't know about
any particular headers - they are all registered at run-time by the application.
There are two parsers: the first is for parsing MIME headers and the
second is for parsing MIME footers. They are both converters that
can be set up using the HTConverterInit
function in the libwww setup module

There is also a default set of the headers defined by the
HTTP/1.1 specification
which can be initialized using the
HTMIMEInit() function in the
libwww setup module.

/*
(
  MIME Entity Header Generation
)

When sending a MIME entity along with a request, for example using NNTP or
HTTP, the entity headers are generated by the MIME generator stream. This
stream will be added to the output stream pipe in order to decorate the outgoing
request.

/*
(
  Default MIME Header Parsers
)

The Library's MIME parser is divided into two parts: A generic MIME parser
that knows how to unwrap all RFC822 headers and specialized header parsers
that knows how to parse Content-Length, for example. This is
the default set of the specialized MIME header parsers that can be registered
as part of the generic MIME. Note that these functions are not registered
by default - they must be registered by the application. This can be done
using the HTMIMEInit() function in the
WWWInit interface. Of course this can also be
used to register new headers that are not represented below - or if you want
to replace a default parser then this is also very easy.
*/
#include "HTMIMImp.h"

/*
(
  Multipart MIME Parsing and Generation
)

Libwww supports MIME multipart generation and parsing using two streams.
The parser stream is a converter that can be setup for"converting" the MIME
body parts into separate documents. The MIME multipart stream parser can
be set up by using the HTConverterInit
function in the libwww setup module.
