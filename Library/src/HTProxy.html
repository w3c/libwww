This module keeps a list of proxies and gateways to be contacted on a
request in stead of requesting it directly from the origin server. The
module replaces the old system of environment variables for gateways
and proxies. However for backward compatibility there is a function
that reads the environment variables at start up. Note that there is a
difference between a proxy and a gateway - the difference is the way
the URL is set up in the <EM>RequestLine</EM> of the HTTP request. If
the original, full URL looks like
<CODE>"http://www.w3.org/test.html"</CODE> then the result will for a
proxy is <CODE>"http://www.w3.org/test.html"</CODE> and a gateway
<CODE>"/www.w3.org/test.html"</CODE> <P>

The module is implemented by <A HREF="HTProxy.c">HTProxy.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<A NAME="proxy"><H2>Registering a proxy server</H2></A>

A proxy server is registered with a corresponding access method, for
example <EM>http</EM>, <EM>ftp</EM> etc. The `proxy' parameter should
be a fully valid name, like <CODE>http://proxy.w3.org:8001</CODE> but
domain name is not required. If an entry exists for this access then
delete it and use the new one.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTProxy_add		(CONST char * access, CONST char * proxy);
extern BOOL HTProxy_deleteAll	(void);
</PRE>

The remove function removes all registered proxies. This is
automatically done in <A HREF="HTAccess.html#Library">
HTLibTerminate()</A>

<A NAME="noproxy"><H2>Registering a host or domain with no proxy</H2></A>

The <EM>noproxy</EM> list is a list of host names and domain names
where we don't contact a proxy even though a proxy is in fact
registered for this particular access method . When registering a
<EM>noproxy</EM> item, you can specify a specific port for this access
method in which case it isvalid only for requests to this port. If
`port' is '0' then it applies to all ports and if `access' is NULL
then it applies to to all access methods. Examples of host names are
<CODE>w3.org</CODE> and <CODE>www.close.com</CODE>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNoProxy_add	(CONST char * host, CONST char * access,
				 unsigned port);
extern BOOL HTNoProxy_deleteAll	(void);
</PRE>

The remove function removes all entries in the list. This is
automatically done in <A HREF="HTAccess.html#Library">
HTLibTerminate()</A>

<H2>Look for a Proxy server</H2>

This function evaluates the lists of registered proxies and if
one is found for the actual access method and it is not registered
in the `noproxy' list, then a URL containing the host to be contacted
is returned to the caller. This string must be freed be the caller.

<PRE>
extern char * HTProxy_find	(CONST char * url);
</PRE>

<A NAME="gateway"><H2>Registering a gateway</H2></A>

A gateway is registered with a corresponding access method, for
example <EM>http</EM>, <EM>ftp</EM> etc. The `gate' parameter should
be a fully valid name, like <CODE>http://gateway.w3.org:8001</CODE>
but domain name is not required. If an entry exists for this access
then delete it and use the new one.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTGateway_add	(CONST char * access, CONST char * gate);
extern BOOL HTGateway_deleteAll	(void);
</PRE>

The remove function removes all registered proxies. This is
automatically done in <A HREF="HTAccess.html#Library">
HTLibTerminate()</A>

<H2>Look for a Gateway</H2>

This function evaluates the lists of registered gateways and if one is
found for the actual access method then it is returned and must be
freed by the caller.

<PRE>
extern char * HTGateway_find	(CONST char * url);
</PRE>

<H2>Backwards Compability with Environment Variables</H2>

This function maintains backwards compatibility with the old
environment variables and searches for the most common values: http,
ftp, news, wais, and gopher
