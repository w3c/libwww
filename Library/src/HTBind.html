<H1>File Suffix Bind Manager</H1>

This module sets up the binding between a file Bind and a media type,
language, encoding etc. In a client application the Binds are used in
protocols that does not support media types etc., like FTP, and in
server applications they are used to make the bindings between the
server and the local file store that the server can serve to the rest
of the world (well almost). The <A HREF="HTFormat.html">HTFormat
module</A> holds this information against the accept headers received
in a request and uses if for format negotiation. All the binding
management can all be replace by a database interface. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTBind.c">HTBind.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.

<H2>Initialization of the Module</H2>

These functions must be called on startup and termination of the
application. This is done automatically by <A
HREF="HTReq.html#Library">HTLibInit() and HTLibTerminate()</A>.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_init		(void);
extern BOOL HTBind_deleteAll	(void);
</PRE>

<H2>Case Sensitivity</H2>

Should the search for suffixes be case sensitive or not? The default
value is <EM>case sensitive</EM>.

<PRE>
extern void HTBind_caseSensitive	(BOOL sensitive);
</PRE>

<H2>Suffix Delimiters</H2>

Change the set of suffix delimiters. The default is a platform
dependent set defined in the <A HREF="tcp.html">tcp module</A>.

<PRE>
extern CONST char *HTBind_delimiters	(void);
extern void HTBind_setDelimiters	(CONST char * new_suffixes);
</PRE>

<H2>Set up Bindings Associated with a File Suffix</H2>

There are three types of bindings:

<UL>
<LI>Content Type (media type)
<LI>Language
<LI>Content Encoding
</UL>

And the associated set of methods is defined as:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_add		(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	representation,
				 CONST char *	encoding,
				 CONST char *	language,
				 double		value);

extern BOOL HTBind_addType	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	format,
				 double		value);

extern BOOL HTBind_addEncoding	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	encoding,
				 double		value);

extern BOOL HTBind_addLanguage	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	language,
				 double		value);
</PRE>

The first method is a "super" method for binding information to a file
suffic. Any of the string values can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If filename
suffix is already defined its previous definition is overridden or
modified. For example, a <CODE>HTBind_setType</CODE> and
<CODE>HTBind_setEncoding</CODE> can be called with the same suffix.<P>

Calling this with suffix set to "*" will set the default
representation. Calling this with suffix set to "*.*" will set the
default representation for unknown suffix files which contain a "." <P>

<B>NOTE:</B> The suffixes <EM>can</EM> contain characters that must be
escaped in a URL. However, they should <EM>not</EM> be encoded when
parsed as the <CODE>suffix</CODE> parameter.

<H2>Determine a suitable suffix</H2>

Use the set of bindings to find a suitable suffix (or index) for a
certain combination of language, media type and encoding given in the
anchor. Returns a pointer to a suitable suffix string that must be freed 
by the caller. If more than one suffix is found they are all
concatenated. If no suffix is found, NULL is returned.

<PRE>
extern char * HTBind_getSuffix	(HTParentAnchor * anchor);
</PRE>


<H2>Determine the content of an Anchor</H2>

Use the set of bindings to find the combination of language, media
type and encoding of a given anchor. If more than one suffix is found
they are all searched. The last suffix has highest priority, the first
one lowest. Returns the anchor object with the representations
found. See also <CODE>HTBind_getFormat</CODE>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_getBindings	(HTParentAnchor * anchor);
</PRE>

<H2>Determine the content of File</H2>

Use the set of bindings to find the combination of language, media
type and encoding of a given anchor. If more than one suffix is found
they are all searched. The last suffix has highest priority, the first
one lowest. Returns the format, encoding, and language found. See also
<CODE>HTBind_getBindings</CODE>.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_getFormat	(CONST char *	filename,
				 HTFormat *	format,
				 HTEncoding *	encoding,
				 HTLanguage *	language,
				 double *	quality);
</PRE>

<H2>Multi Format Management</H2>

Use the set of bindings to find the combination of language, media
type and encoding of a given anchor. If more than one suffix is found
they are all searched. The last suffix has highest priority, the first
one lowest. Returns the format, encoding, and language found. See also
<CODE>HTBind_getBindings</CODE>, and <CODE>HTBind_getFormat</CODE>.

<PRE>
#define MULTI_SUFFIX ".multi"   /* Extension for scanning formats */
#define MAX_SUFF 15		/* Maximum number of suffixes for a file */

extern HTContentDescription * HTBind_getDescription (char * file);
</PRE>

End of declaration module
