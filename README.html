<H1>W3C Source Code Distribution Packages</H1>

<HR>

<PRE>
	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
</PRE>

This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar
files. The package contains source code for building World-Wide Web
applications and related reference applications. In its full contents
it contains the source code for the following modules:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Library/">W3C Reference Library</A>
<LI><A HREF="Daemon/">CERN HTTPD</A>
<LI><A HREF="LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>
<LI><A HREF="NextStep/Status.html">Next Browser/Editor</A>
</UL>

At the bottom of this file, you will find pointers to more information.

<H2>Handling the Distribution Files</H2>

All distribution files contain the source code for each of the
modules. W3C also provides a wide set of precompiled binaries which
are available either <A HREF="../Dist/bin">directly via HTTP</A> or
via anonymous FTP from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.w3.org/">ftp.w3.org</A>.<P>

All of the distribution packets are available as compressed tar files,
and some are also available as zip files. For the compressed tar
files, first uncompress and untar the file
<CODE>&lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z</CODE> where <CODE>&lt;dist&gt;</CODE> is the
name of the specific distribution:

<PRE>
	uncompress &lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z
</PRE>

Then untar the file by typing

<PRE>
	tar xf &lt;dist&gt;.tar
</PRE>

For the zip files, type the following:

<PRE>
	unzip &lt;dist&gt;.zip
</PRE>


<A NAME="dirstruc"><H2>Generated Directory structure</H2></A>

The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this)
directory. They create different parts of a common directory tree
under that directory. There may be some duplication. They also
generate a few files in this directory: README, COPYRIGH, and some
installation instructions. The structure of the untar'ed package is as
follows (directories):

<PRE>
	WWW				Top-node

	WWW/All/*/Makefile.include	Platform dependent make files

	WWW/Library			W3C Reference Library
	WWW/Library/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/Library/&lt;platform&gt;/*	Platform dependent object files

	WWW/Daemon			CERN HTTPD
	WWW/Daemon/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/Daemon/&lt;platform&gt;/*		Platform dependent object files

	WWW/LineMode			LineMode Browser
	WWW/LineMode/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/LineMode/&lt;platform&gt;/*	Platform dependent object files

	WWW/Next			Next Browser/Editor
	WWW/Next/Implementation		Source Code
	WWW/Next/&lt;platform&gt;/*		Platform dependent object files
</PRE>

Some or more of these directories might not be there. This depends on
the number of distribution files. In general there is one distribution
file pr. module (Library, LineMode Browser, and Daemon). The Library
distribution file is required for all the other module.

<H2>Compilation</H2>

Compilation can be put into two groups depending on if the platform is
supported in the BUILD script or not. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script is
placed in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory and you can use it to compile
and link the W3C applications. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script figures out
what platform you are on and generates a <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which
consists of a platform independent part and a platform dependent part.

<H3>Compilation on already supported platforms</H3>

To <CODE>BUILD</CODE> any of the applications go to the WWW directory
and type

<PRE>
	./BUILD library

	./BUILD daemon

	./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

or simply 

<PRE>
	./BUILD
</PRE>

in order to BUILD all applications

<H3>Compilation on Non-Supported Platforms</H3>

This will require some more work, but please read the <A
HREF="Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">online
documentation</A> <B>[1]</B>. <P>

For Windows NT we have a special <A
HREF="README-WinNT">README-WinNT</A> file provided by Charlie Brooks.

<H2>W3C Reference Library</H2>

The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that
can be used to build clients and servers. It contains code for
accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local
file system. Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and
presenting hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic
programming utilities. The Library is the basis for many <A
HREF="TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</A> applications and all the W3C
software is build on top of it. The Library is a required part of all
other W3C applications in this distribution. <P>

You can get more information from the <A HREF="Library/">online
documentation</A> <B>[2]</B> and if you don't have a WWW client then
telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid or password required)
and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>LineMode Browser</H2>

The Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.  It
is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the
Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non-
interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety
of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is
primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used
in batch jobs.<P>

Installation is very simple as the application can run without any
particular seup. You can specify your own <EM>HOME PAGE</EM> using the
<CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable. Remember toy setup a
<CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> environment variable before you try to access
a news server. <P>

You can get more information from the is available at <A
HREF="LineMode/">online documentation</A> <B>[3]</B> and if you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>Server</H2>

CERN httpd is a generic public domain full-featured hypertext server
which can be used as a regular HTTP server. The running typically on
port 80 to serve hypertext and other documents, and also as a proxy --
a server on a firewall machine -- that provides access for people
inside a firewall to the outside world. When running as proxy httpd
may be configured to do caching of documents resulting in faster
response times. <P>

Follow instructions above for compiling and then go on to "<A
NAME="z9" HREF="Daemon/User/Installation/Installation.html">
Installing the basic W3 server</A>". <P>

You can get more information from the is available at <A
HREF="Daemon/">online documentation</A> <B>[4]</B> and if you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>NeXTStep Browser/Editor</H2>

The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is
compiled. When you install the app, you may want to configure the
default page, WorldWideWeb.app/default.html. These must point to some
useful information! You should keep it up to date with pointers to
info on your site and elsewhere. If you use the W3C home page note
there is a link at the bottom to the master copy on our server. You
should set up the address of your local news server with

<PRE>
	dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost news
</PRE>

replacing the last word with the actual address of your news host.
See <A NAME="6" HREF="NextStep/Installation.html">Installation
instructions</A>. <P>

You can get more information from the is available at is available at
<A HREF="NextStep/Status.html">online documentation</A> <B>[5]</B> and
if you don't have a WWW client then telnet to
<CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid or password required) and you
will get the Line Mode Browser.
