   Handling the Distribution Files
 </H2>
 <P>
 A distribution file contains the source code and documentation for the Library
 and the example applications. You can get the distribution files from the
 <A HREF="Library/">Library top page</A> All distribution files are available
 as compressed tar files, gzipped tar files, or as zip files. For the compressed
 tar files, first uncompress and untar the file
 <CODE><I>w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.Z</I></CODE> where X is the version number, for
 example <I>4.0</I>:
 <PRE>	uncompress w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.Z
 
 	gunzip w3c-libwww-X.X.tar.gz
 </PRE>
 <P>
 Then untar the file by typing
 <PRE>	tar xf w3c-libwww-X.X.tar
 </PRE>
 <P>
 For the zip files, type the following:
 <PRE>	unzip w3c-libwww-X.X.zip

   Installation
 </H2>
 <P>
 Please look at the special <A HREF="INSTALL.html">installation
 documentation</A>
 <H2>
   <A NAME="Reference">Sample Code Library (libwww)</A>
 </H2>
 <P>
 The <A HREF="Library/">W3C Sample Code Library</A> is a general code base
 that can be used to build clients and servers. It contains code for accessing
 HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system.
 Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting hypertext
 objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming utilities.
 The Library is the basis for many <A HREF="TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</A>
 applications and all the W3C software is build on top of it. The Library
 is a required part of all other W3C applications in this distribution.
 <H2>
   <A NAME="Line">Line Mode Browser (www)</A>
 </H2>
 <P>
 The <A HREF="LineMode/">W3C Line Mode Browser</A> is a simple character based
 client. It is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for
 the Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non- interactive
 mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities
 for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a
 test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in batch jobs.
 <P>
 Installation is very simple as the application can run without any particular
 setup. You can specify your own <EM>HOME PAGE</EM> using the
 <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable. Remember toy setup a
 <CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> environment variable before you try to access a news
 server.

   <A NAME="Mini">Mini Server (webd)</A>
 </H2>
 <P>
 <B>This tool is not maintained anymore!!!</B>
 <P>
 The <A HREF="MiniServ/">W3C Mini Server</A> is a cross platform server frame
 work that can be used as a basis for writing portable servers. It is
 <B>NOT</B> a full server - only a frame! It is developed in C and serves
 as an example of a server application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C
 Sample Code Library</A>.
 <H2>
   <A NAME="Command">Command Line Tool (w3c)</A>
 </H2>
 <P>
 The <A HREF="ComLine/">W3C Command Line Tool</A> is a cross platform command
 line tool for accessing the Web. It is developed in C and serves as an example
 of a client application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample Code
 Library</A> and as a test-tool for quick access to the Web from scripts,
 cron jobs etc. It gives a variety of possibilities for data format conversion,
 filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to
 the Web or used in scripts, cron jobs etc.

   <A NAME="robot">Mini Robot (webbot)</A>
 </H2>
 <P>
 The <A HREF="Robot/">W3C Mini Robot</A> is a cross platform command line
 tool for accessing the Web. It is developed in C and serves as an example
 of a robot application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample Code
 Library</A> and as a test-tool for quick access to the Web from scripts,
 cron jobs etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to
 the Web or used in scripts, cron jobs etc.
 <H2>
   <A NAME="Socket">Socket Listen Tool (listen)</A>
 </H2>
