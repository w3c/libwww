  W3C Reference Library Installation
</H1>
<PRE>
	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
</PRE>
<P>
These installation instructions are based on the suggested instructions provided
with GNU Autoconf 2.0.
<P>
The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values
to create a `Makefile' and a `config.h' file containing system-dependent
definitions. Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you
can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring,
and a file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging
`configure').
<H2>
  Building on Windows
</H2>
<P>
Building on Windows is somewhat different than building on Unix. We therefore
have a separate set of directions for doing this. We do maintain a set of
Microsoft Visual C make files which can be used directly. If you do not use
this compiler then please read the instructions on how you can move this
to other compilers.

Stop here and jump to the <A HREF="Library/User/Patch/">Known Bugs and

<H2>
  Building on Unix
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Icons/32x32/caution" ALT="Note" BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">
You probably need the <A HREF="Library/User/Platform/GNUMake.html">GNU version
of make</A> in order to build libwww.
<P>
The simplest way to compile this package on a Unix platform is:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type `./configure'
    to configure the package for your system. If you're using `csh' on an old
    version of System V, you might need to type `sh ./configure' instead to prevent
    `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself. Running `configure' takes
    awhile. While running, it prints some messages telling which features for
    which it is checking.
  <LI>
    Stop here and jump to the <A HREF="Library/User/Patch/">Known Bugs and
    Patches</A> page to see if you need to apply any patches before you compile.
  <LI>
    Type `make' to compile the package.
  <LI>
    Type `make install' to install the library.
  <LI>
    You can remove the library and object files from the source directory by
    typing `make clean.' To also remove the files that `configure' created (so
    you can compile the package for a different kind of computer), type `make
    distclean.'
</OL>
<H2>
  Compilers and Options
</H2>
<P>
Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about. You can give `configure' initial
values for variables by setting them in the environment. Using a
Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like this:
<PRE>
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
</PRE>
<P>
Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
<PRE>
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
</PRE>
<H2>
  Using a Different Build Directory
</H2>
<P>
You can compile the package in a directory different from the one containing
the source code. Doing so allows you to compile it on more than one kind
of computer at the same time. To do this, you must use a version of `make'
that supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make.' `cd' to the directory
where you want to object files and library to go and run the `configure'
script (i.e., go `../src/configure'). `configure' automatically checks for
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..' as well.
<H2>
  Installation Names
</H2>
<P>
By default, `make install' will install the library in `/usr/local/lib.'
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH.' You can cause the library to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on its name by giving `configure' the options
`--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX.'
<H2>
  <A NAME="features">Optional Features</A>
</H2>
<P>
There are four options you can give to `configure' in addition to those
understood by all GNU Autoconf `configure' scripts:
<DL>
  <DT>
    --enable-posix
  <DD>
    This enables the <CODE>_POSIX_SOURCE</CODE> define which guarantees that
    the code only contains strictly POSIX compliant features.
  <DT>
    --enable-reentrant
  <DD>
    If you are building a thread safe applications, you need to use the reentrant
    versions of the system calls where the caller provides a buffer instead of
    using a static memory buffer which gets overridden on every call. Please
    note that <EM>libwww</EM> isn't thread safe throughout the code as not all
    functions are reentrant.
  <DT>
    --with-wais
  <DD>
    This option causes the library to be built to directly use WAIS access, if
    the `configure' script can find the WAIS distribution nearby. `Nearby' means
    that `configure' will look for a directory with `wais' in its name (case
    is not significant) either one, two, or three directories above the source
    directory.
  <DT>
    --with-socks
  <DD>
    This option causes the library to be build to use the SOCKS firewall-crossing
    code, if the `configure' script can find the SOCKS distribution nearby. `Nearby'
    means the same as it did above, but with `socks' in the directory name instead.
</DL>
<H2>
  Specifying the System Type
</H2>
<P>
There may be some features `configure' can not figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of host the package will run on. Usually
`configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a message saying it can
not guess the host type, give it the `--host=TYPE' option. TYPE can either
be a short name for the system type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name
with three fields:
<PRE>
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
</PRE>
<P>
See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field. If `config.sub'
isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't need to know the
host type.
<P>
If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also use
the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will produce
code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of system on which
you are compiling the package.
<H2>
  Sharing Defaults
</H2>
<P>
If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you can
create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default values
for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'. `configure' looks for
`PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then `PREFIX/etc/config.site' if
it exists. Or, you can set the `CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the
location of the site script. A warning: not all `configure' scripts look
for a site script.
<H2>
  Operation Controls
</H2>
<P>
`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.
<DL>
  <DT>
    --cache-file=FILE
  <DD>
    Save the results of the tests in FILE instead of `config.cache'. Set FILE
    to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for debugging `configure'.
  <DT>
    --help
  <DD>
    Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
  <DT>
    --quiet
  <DD>
  <DT>
    --silent
  <DD>
  <DT>
    -q
  <DD>
    Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
  <DT>
    --srcdir=DIR
  <DD>
    Look for the package's source code in directory DIR. Usually `configure'
    can determine that directory automatically.
  <DT>
    --version
  <DD>
    Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure' script, and
    exit.
  <DT>
    `configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
  <DD>
</DL>
